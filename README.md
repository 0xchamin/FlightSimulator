# Global Flight RL Simulator

A browser-based reinforcement learning educational game that teaches core RL concepts through realistic drone navigation between global destinations.

## Features

- **Interactive World Map**: Click any two points globally to set flight routes
- **Multiple Flight Agents**:
  - Manual Control (arrow keys)
  - Baseline Agent (deterministic great circle path)
  - Q-Learning Agent (learns optimal flight strategies)
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live fuel tracking, learning progress, and performance metrics
- **Agent Comparison**: Side-by-side performance comparison table

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click two points on the map to set your route
3. Select an agent type from the dropdown
4. Click "Start Flight" and watch the learning in action

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Q-Learning fundamentals
- Compare human vs AI decision-making
- Visualize exploration vs exploitation trade-offs
